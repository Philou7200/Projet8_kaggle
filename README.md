# Predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Main Part
The project is coding with python 3.0

The application UI has 2 main sections:
- Exploration of the dataset
    - train dataset size : (891, 12)
    - test dataset size : (418, 11)
 
- Classification and prection of surviver
    - one branch with an MLP Classifer
    - one branch with an Random forest Classifer
    - one branch with an KNN Classifer
